                    Hi dog lovers! I’m definitely one of you! I like to say I’ve been in the dog care business since
                    birth! I grew up with my very own puppy brother, Oliver, till we were both 12 years old. When he
                    passed, I occupied my time with neighborhood dog walking and sitting for six years. I went off to
                    university to pursue a career as a vet. It was then when I worked as a part-time dog and cat
                    groomer. I learned from the best and was able to conceptualize my own luxury experience for our
                    furry friends. I incorporate medicated baths, massage techniques taken from around the world, and
                    also psycho therapy. Canine mental health matters! After undergrad, I pivoted to a more
                    business-oriented mindset with all that I learned as a groomer. I obtained an MBA from Columbia and
                    co-founded Fetch with Pho, Alexandria and Victor. I look forward to caring for your dog pals in a
                    way that will blow your minds.
